          My name is Ommi Putera K., I work at <b>Dipay Indonesia</b> as a Full
          Stack Engineer. I am passionate about crafting quality software that
          makes a positive impact.

        <p className="text-sm font-normal leading-5">
          I was preparing to start my career after graduating with an economics
          degree when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in late 2019. The widespread
          layoffs across industries made me rethink my career path. Amid this
          uncertainty, I discovered the thriving field of digital technology,
          particularly web development. Determined to seize the opportunity, I
          enrolled in the <b>Purwadhika Digital Technology Schoolâ€™s</b> Full
          Stack Web and Mobile Development Bootcamp in early 2021.
        </p>
        <Br />
        <p className="text-sm font-normal leading-5">
          During the program, I discovered my true passion for coding and web
          development. It sparked a deep commitment to continuous learning and
          growth as a software engineer. I aim to contribute to innovative
          projects that drive meaningful change.

          I was born in 1998 in Bengkulu, Indonesia. My journey into tech began
          unexpectedly. After earning a degree in economics, I was set to start
          my career when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted industries in late
          2019. Facing widespread layoffs, I began exploring new opportunities â€”
          and that&apos;s when I discovered digital technology.

          I was born in 1998 in Bengkulu, Indonesia. My journey into tech began
          in an unexpected way. After earning my degree in economics, I was
          ready to launch my career when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in late
          2019. With industries facing widespread layoffs, I started searching
          for new pathsâ€”and that&apos;s when I stumbled upon the dynamic world
          of digital technology.

          Digital Technology School&apos;s Full Stack Web and Mobile Development

          and sparked my enthusiasm for continuous growth in software
          engineering.

            As an engineer, I believe learning is a lifelong journey. Staying

            personal growth but also keeps me adaptable in a constantly evolving

            Collaboration thrives on humility and mutual respect. I prioritize
            open communication and value the contributions of every team member,
            regardless of their background or experience. By fostering a
            supportive and inclusive environment, I help teams unlock their full

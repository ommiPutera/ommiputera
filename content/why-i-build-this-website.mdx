I've been incredibly fortunate to learn so much about web development from the countless free resources available online. From insightful blog posts to in-depth YouTube tutorials, these creators have generously shared their knowledge, helping me grow both personally and professionally. Without this open sharing of expertise, my journey into web development might have looked very different.

## Motivation

Creating this website is my way of giving back to the community that has given me so much. I want it to be more than just a portfolio—it's a space where I can document my growth, share lessons learned, and discuss challenges I've faced along the way.

By sharing my experiences, projects, and insights, I hope to inspire others who are just starting out or looking for direction in their careers. Whether it’s a beginner stumbling upon their first coding challenge or a fellow developer exploring new ideas, I aim to contribute to the vibrant, collaborative spirit of the web development world.

This website isn’t just a showcase of my work—it’s a celebration of the power of shared knowledge and community. My hope is that it becomes a resource, a source of inspiration, and a small way to pay it forward. This site is also a reminder to myself to keep learning and stay curious, embracing every opportunity to grow alongside this ever-evolving field.

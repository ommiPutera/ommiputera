shadcn/ui is a collection of reusable components with an approach that, in my opinion, is highly favored by many developers: "copy and paste." However, beyond that, this approach is also a game changer for developers in building a component library for web application projects.

So, what does it mean? Letâ€™s dive in...

## Full Control

For developers familiar with or working within the React ecosystem, building a component library from scratch can be a daunting task. UI Component Libraries like Material-UI, Mantine, and Chakra UI provide practical solutions for creating component libraries. However, customizing functionality, UI, and UX to align with a design system can be exhausting, and itâ€™s not uncommon for components to fall short of designer expectations ðŸ˜­.

With shadcn/ui, I have full control over the code for each component, deciding how the components in my project are built and styled. And, of course, I have unlimited freedom to develop each component according to the specific needs of the project.

## Modularity

Most components in shadcn/ui are built using headless component libraries like Radix Primitives, which offer two key features: accessibility and unstyled components.

Each component built with Radix Primitives adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This ensures that the components are not only functional but also inclusive and accessible to end users, including those relying on assistive technologies like screen readers.

This modular approach makes shadcn/ui not only quick to implement but also highly adaptable to application requirements, without the additional complexity often associated with manually meeting accessibility standards.

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I created React Testing Library because I wasn't satisfied with the testing landscape at the time. It expanded to DOM Testing Library and now we have Testing Library implementations (wrappers) for every popular JavaScript framework and testing tool that targets the DOM (and even some that don't).

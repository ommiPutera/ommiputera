Finding a sweet spot in the middle of the spectrum of abstraction is key to
developing maintainable tests.

## ANA Testing

The best example of "Absolutely No Abstraction" I've seen in testing is for
[ExpressJS route handlers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). For you
to understand what I mean when I say "ANA is bad for testing" I'm going to give
you a typical test file and ask you to pretend you're going to maintain this
codebase and these tests. It's important for you to understand how this route
works. You're relieved that there are tests in place which will help you make
sure you're not going to break something. So now you're going to use the tests
to understand the nuances of the route handler.

Try to read this test and understand the one nuance between the two of them.
